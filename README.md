Nautilus MockUp WireFrame

This project is a digital wireframe of the Nautilus site. The purpose is to render the content as close to the original as I am able right now.

The process:

I forked the original site, cloned it and installed all its dependencies suing git.
I then incorporated the images within different React components and styled and text content using CSS.

I empolyed mostly flex for the different components. And used grid for one.
